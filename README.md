# jannaee.github.io
Jannaee's personal website, a place to showcase professional work as well as the ongoings in my day to day life. 

The version of this website as you see it today was originally created with Google Web Starter Kit "A front-end template that helps you build fast, modern mobile web apps."

As the year progresses I have plans to redesign this website from scratch.

Goals include:
Experimenting with GSAP and svg animations.
Implementing ARIA Roles, responsive images using srcset.
Incorporating a task runner to help automate task flows on build.
Displaying more JavaScript projects.
