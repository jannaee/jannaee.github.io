## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### **Color Palette**
The site uses a custom color scheme derived from my original work-life balance illustration:

```css
--navy-deep: #1a3a52;      /* Primary dark */
--navy-medium: #2d5a7b;    /* Secondary dark */
--cyan: #6DD5ED;           /* Accent blue */
--yellow: #FFD93D;         /* Accent yellow */
--white: #ffffff;          /* Background */
--gray-50: #fafbfc;        /* Light backgrounds */
```

### **Typography**
- **Primary Font**: System font stack (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI)
- **Responsive Sizing**: clamp() for fluid typography
- **Hierarchy**: Clear heading levels with appropriate sizing

### **Animations**
- Scroll-triggered reveal animations
- Hover micro-interactions
- Smooth transitions (cubic-bezier easing)
- Carousel auto-advance with manual controls
