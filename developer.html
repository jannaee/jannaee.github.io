          <p> I am an animal-loving, on-and-off-yoga-practicing, small-batch-whiskey-drinking, tinkerer-of-anything-3D-printing kind of a gal. I was born in Busan, South Korea and raised in 'Duuuuuuuval' county of Jacksonville, Florida.</p><p>I'm a graduate of <a href="http://www.duvalschools.org/stanton" target="_blank">Stanton College Preparatory High School</a> and of the <a href="http://www.unf.edu/coas/art-design/" target="_blank">University of North Florida</a>. After earning my BA in Fine Arts with a focus in graphic design I set forth into the world determined to make art. As you will find throughout this site I've littered it with projects that I've created (or at least participated in).</p>

              <p>For this project I developed a way to import data from an HR database and display it onto our public website. The requirements for this project included allowing the table to be sortable by and dynamic. The image above features the final design of the list as it exists today.</p>
              <p>Currently, the production version of this list is a manual process.

              <p>This assignment required creating a method to allow online account users to store away their user id's for future sessions. It was determined this feature should only support users of modern browsers. As a result, I opted to take advantage of using html5 local storage.</p>

                One of the fun projects I had a chance to work on as a developer for EverBank. While this screenshot doesn't do the final design justice, I worked with a designer to create a banner ad that would dynamically pull in and display rates from our rates source. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My first attempt at creating this banner included using Raphael JS framework. However, since these are retargeting ads, meant to live on various sites, the file needed to be all encompassing and the library proved to be too big. My fall back solution involved recreating these ads to use only css for animation, which I achieved by leveraging the Animate.css library.

              <p>At times, what a client asks for isn't necessarily what is truly needed. I find in these moments, it is our role as a developer to identify these situations and for us to consider responding with an alternate approach. In this instance of the rates table, it was requested of our team to supply rates to a third party vendor. The vendor would require daily refreshed rates, preferrably in a csv file in order for them to feed their web banners. </p>
              <p>I built a tool that provided unlimited access to the most up to date rates. This tool features a download button that converts the list into a downladable csv or txt file.</p>
