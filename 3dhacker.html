          <p>My interest in 3D printing began when I befriended an awesome woman in Vegas who introduced me to the world of additive printing, commonly known as 3D printing. She showed me a ring that she designed herself and printed. I was transfixed with this concept and my love affair with 3D printing began. I am a collector of unique and interesting jewelry I <em>had</em> to buy one of her pieces, <a href="http://owlposse.com/shop/" target="_blank">owl posse</a>. Several years later, I finally added a 3D printer to my collection of curiosities.</p>

          <p>The printer that I purchased was a kit, where nothing was assembled. I obsessively worked on building this machine from ground up and enjoyed every minute of it. It's an amazing experience to build one, and understand it's inner workings. From the zip ties to ball bearings, and wiring the motors to the ciricuit board, my printer feels as though it is a part of me. By the end of August I was printing out little plastic test cubes, but some day I hope to create a mini replica of Johnny-five.</p>
