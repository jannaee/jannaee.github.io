# [Apache Server Configs](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/h5bp/server-configs-apache.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/h5bp/server-configs-apache)

__Apache Server Configs__ is a collection of boilerplate configurations that
can help your server improve the web site's performance and security, while
also ensuring that resources are served with the correct content-type and are
accessible, if needed, even cross-domain.

## Usage

If you have access to the [main server configuration
file](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/configuring.html#main)
(usually called `httpd.conf`), you should add the logic from the
[`.htaccess`](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/master/src/.htaccess)
file in, for example, a
[`<Directory>`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#directory)
section in the main configuration file. This is usually the recommended way, as
using `.htaccess` files [slows
down](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html#when) Apache!

If you don't have access, which is quite common with hosting services, just copy
the [`.htaccess`](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/master/src/.htaccess)
file in the root of the website.

Also note that some configurations won't have any effect if the appropriate
modules aren't enabled. So, in order for everything to work as intended, you
need to ensure the you have the following Apache modules
[enabled](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/wiki/How-to-enable-Apache-modules):
  * [`mod_autoindex.c` (autoindex_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_autoindex.html)
  * [`mod_deflate.c` (deflate_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html)
  * [`mod_expires.c` (expires_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_expires.html)
  * [`mod_filter.c` (filter_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_filter.html)
  * [`mod_headers.c` (headers_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html)
  * [`mod_include.c` (include_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_include.html)
  * [`mod_mime.c` (mime_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html)
  * [`mod_rewrite.c` (rewrite_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html)
  * [`mod_setenvif.c` (setenvif_module)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_setenvif.html)
